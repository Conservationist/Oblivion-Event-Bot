Major shit to do:
    ☐ Start converting helpers.js since that's going to take the most time, and be the most annoying @high  
    ☐ Figure typescript the fuck out @critical 
    ☐ Probably going to rework some of the helpers, make them more usable everywhre
	☐ Have to remember that event id is now the mongoid _id, and set that up correctly, shouldn't be hard just gotta remember
	☐ Maybe look into docker again?
	☐ Start working on specifying a specific date for events, so they can be planned ahead.
	☐ Track old messages if the bot goes down, pr useful feature.
