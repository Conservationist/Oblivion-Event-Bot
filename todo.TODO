Shit to do:
	✔ make returnyeslist & returnnolist same function, literaly 1 word diff between them @low @today  @done (August 2nd 2018, 12:34)
	☐ finish converting the code to new modular system. (setEventChannel, setListChannel, then gotta make setAnnounceChannel)
	☐ going to create a new command system, lots of if statements not practical
	☐ addevent.js is also going to announnce the new event created.
	☐ need to work on a group building feature, thinking it will DM the user with what role they want to select, then group leaders will have a command to view the group
	☐ need to improve error handling across the board, logging has now been implemented, bot shouldn't crash anymore also.
	☐ start fucking around with dates so events can be planned days in advance.
	☐ keep commands simple and user friendly & make embeds look sxy.
	☐ fuck that java guy wanting to do everything in java
